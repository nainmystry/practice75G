/*
* Given a list of employee work schedules with each employee having a list of non-overlapping intervals representing their working hours, 
* we are tasked with finding the common free time for all employees, or in other words, the times when all employees are not working.
* The input is a nested list of intervals, each interval as [start, end], with start < end. 
* The intervals are non-overlapping and are already sorted in ascending order. 
* The output should also be a list of sorted intervals.
* For example, consider schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]. 
* Here, Employee 1 works from 1 to 3 and 6 to 7. 
* Employee 2 works from 2 to 4 and Employee 3 works from 2 to 5 and 9 to 12. 
* The common free time for all employees is [5,6] and [7,9] as these are the intervals when all employees are free.
