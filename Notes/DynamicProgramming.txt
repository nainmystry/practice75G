DP has 2 Main Approaches
- Memoization (Top-Down Approach)
- Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)

Memoization - is a top-down approach where results of expensive function calls are stored and reused.
Tabulation - is a bottom-up approach that builds up a table of results iteratively without recursion.

DP converts main problem into smaller sub problems & stores the value of the sub problem.
In DP, the sub problems are related to each other in some way. (Eg: Fibonnaci) other wise that problem is Divide & Conquer.
- If sub problems are overlapping on each other then choose DP.

0/1 KnapSack Approach. (Weightage given in scenarios, like robbing house, max profit)
- Optimization problem where we have a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and we want to determine the maximum value you can carry in a knapsack (Bag) of limited capacity. 
  Each item can either be included or excluded (hence "0/1").
- Either we pick the ans or not, hence 0/1.
- 2D Matrix Sort (Refer Pepcoding Video)
Problems-

- Maximize The Cut Segments (can be framed similarly to 0/1 Knapsack) (GFG)
